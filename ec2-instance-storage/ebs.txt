ebs = elastic block storage

this is a network storage that can be connected to ec2
one ebs per ec2 (may multiple ebs but more complicated setup)
since it is using network use can detach and attach independently, but at the cost of slower IOPS
it is bound to one AZ
can be moved between AZ/region with snapshot
