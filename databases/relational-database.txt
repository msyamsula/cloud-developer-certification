# RDS (relational database system)

it is a manage service from aws which compatible with
1. postgres
2. mysql
3. oracle

it has product called "aurora" which is a custom made by amazon to enhance database performance

aurora support postgres and mysql
it is claimed that aurora is faster than open source postgres/mysql

you can manually make a snapshot out of your RDS state
then you can do some of following action
1. share the snapshot
2. create new database out of the snapshot
3. move snapshot to another availability zone/region
4. etc

# RDS DEPLOYMENT OPTION
1. read replica
2. multi AZ (availability zone)
3. multi region read replica

for read replica, your will have replica of your main RDS so read load can be distributed between your main RDS and your replicas.
you can have up to 5 read replica.
keep in mind that you still only have one main RDS and every write must go to this main RDS
every write to main RDS will automatically get replicated to replicas, so you have to keep in mind about a replication process (it takes time, not instantly)

Multi AZ is a full backup of your main RDS and its replicas but within different availability zone.
there will be a replication across Multi AZ to ensure that your backup is in sync with your running main RDS.
in case of disaster of AZ. it will automatically promote the backup AZ and keep your system running

Multi region read-replica is an option for you to spawn read replicas outside your main RDS region.
again there will be replication between main and replicas, since it is across region you will get some cost over it.
the write also still goes into main RDS.
this setup is advantageous if you run a global scale system which got read from different region. Having multi region read replica will decrease latency of user in different region
