this is a simple reminder of each deployment & management service in aws, please read more about it if you need detailed understanding.

1. cloud formation = rather than clicking button on aws UI, you can write your resource (ec2, rds, asg, etc) as a code and ask aws to deploy it. (code is it YAML/JSON)
2. cloud development kit = this is a cloud formation but with your preferred language like (python, go, js, java, etc).

10. elastic-beanstalk = this is a platform as a service for a web app in aws.
