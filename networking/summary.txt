this is a brief summary of aws networking

1. vpc = virtual private cloud which is a block of ip address which is connected from each other (your network). VPC live across AZ.
2. public subnet = is a subset of your VPC that live in one AZ. and can access and be accessed from internet.
3. private subnet = is a subset of your VPC that live in one AZ. it cannot be accessed from internet, but it can access internet through NAT gateway.
4. NAT gateway = a service that can make private subnet access internet.
5. Internet gateway = a service that make public subnet can access and be accessed from internet. (think like modem).
6. vpc-peering = it a procedure to merge/connect multiple VPC into one VPC. notes: VPC peering is not transitive.
7. vpc-endpoint = it will make your communication between resource to use private network rather than public network.
8. vpc-flow-log = is a monitoring of your traffic in your vpc.
9. site-to-site VPN = it is like a VPC peering but for connecting on premise with aws VPC.
10. direct connect = connecting on premise with aws VPC via physical connection.
11. client-vpn = connecting local host to private IP of your resource within VPC (makes your local machine looks like within VPC)
12. transit gateway = connect multiple VPCs with star topology with transit gateway as its center.
