dynamoDB is a NoSQL product from amazon, much like mongoDB
it is similar to mongoDB but it is not an implementation of mongoDB.
one dynamoDB instance can be treat as a single table which can store high data and retrieve very fast with its index.

it provide
1. fast retrieval
2. scaling to massive workload
3. no relational, meaning flexible data
4. auto scalling capability

it is a key/value paradigm
key is your unique key
value is your data which can contain many attributes/field

amazon provide a specific cache system for dynamoDB called "dynamoDB accelerator"
so you don't need to use elasticache to cache your flow to dynamoDB

you can have dynamoDB Global Table which is a replication of your main dynamoDB within different region or AZ.
unlike RDS, dynamoDB has active-active replication (two ways replication) means that replica can make a replication to your main dynamoDB.
this make dynamoDB very scallable because beside you decrease the read load. write load of dynamoDB is also decrease by these replication since you can write to any dynamoDB (not limited to main)
