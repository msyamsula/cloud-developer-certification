there are two firewall to manage traffic in aws cloud by default.

They are
1. Network Access Control List (NACL)
2. Security Group

NACL is firewall at subnet level.

it secures all resource within the subnet with user defined rules.

it can have allow or deny traffic rule.

it is stateless meaning return value must also specify in order to go outside/inside the subnet.


Security group is a firewall at instance/resource level.

it secure all the resource with user defined rules.

it can only have allow rule.

it is stateful, meaning for allowed request the return value always allowed going through security group even if you don't specify the request allow rule.
