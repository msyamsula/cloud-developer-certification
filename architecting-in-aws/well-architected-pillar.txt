operational exellence:
prepare, operate, evolve.
perform operation as a code
make documentation automatically (annotation)
frequent, small, reversible changes
anticipate failure
learn from failuer
good monitoring and logging for better MTTA and MTTR

security:
strong identity foundation (centralize privilege management and reduce the need for long term credentials)
principle of least privilege, give only enough privilege for any user to do what they want
traceability, you need to be able to trace your system, metrics, log, activity and then response accordingly
apply security layer, secure your cloud in every layer
protect your data at rest and in transit
keep people away from data
prepare for security event

reliability:
test recovery procedur
auto recover from failure
scale horizontaly
stop guessing the capacity
manage change in automation

performance efficiency:
democratize advance technology
go global in minutes
use serverless
experiment more often
be aware of all aws service

cost optimization:
deliver business value at the lowest possibility
pay only what you use
measure overall efficiency
stop spending money on data center
analyse your expenditure by tags
use managed and application level services

sustainability:
sustain the environment
understand your impact
establish sustainability goals like return of investment, global workload
maximize utilization by right sizing your resource to use efficient energy
anticipate and predict new technology to be adopted. new technology usually consume less energy
leverage cold storage and archive for more effiecient cost storage
