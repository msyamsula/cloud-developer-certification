let say you have app running on your vpc on aws and there is a vendor running on its own vpc on aws.

how do we connect this two app.

1. via public internet, which is risky but doable.
2. via VPC peering, so your VPC is becoming one network with them. which usually unwanted (we need a privacy). this approach also not scalable.
3. private link is a solution. so your VPC and theirs can connect with more secure with private network.

to set up a private link. a requester need to set up ENI (Elastic Network Interface) and the recipient need to setup a Load Balancer.
