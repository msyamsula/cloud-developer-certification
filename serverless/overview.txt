serverless is a term that you dont have to manage/see the ec2 instance behind it.

serverless service will NOT ask you server tier, total server, server ram, cpu, etc.
the moment you create server is automatically created by AWS and will have elastic capability, meaning it will scale automatically.

some example of serverless service:
1. S3
2. dynamoDB
3. fargate
4. lambda 
5. API gateway
