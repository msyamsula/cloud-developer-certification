ECS = elastic container service

it is a service where you want to deploy your docker to amazon

you need to "manually" provision/setup/determined your ec2 instance first. i.e
1. set how many instance of ec-2 do i need
2. is it t2-micro, xlarge, compute optimize, etc

after that ECS will smart enough to assign any new container to your ec2 instances (can be multiple)
