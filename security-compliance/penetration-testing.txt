penetration testing is a test that you do against your own app to check the security level of your app.
usually it conducts to get sensitive data, credential, restricted area, illegal move, etc.

some penetration testing is allowed by default by aws.

however, for some resources you need to contact aws and have its permission to do a penetration testing.
