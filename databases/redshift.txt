redshift is created based from postgres, but it is not suitable for OLTP (transactional database)

redshift best use for OLAP (analytical database) as a data warehouse

since redshift is OLAP then pros and cons of redshift is just OLAP vs OLTP

OLAP is good for keeping huge data and also good for retrieving data, but not in milisecond manner. it is not build to handle huge traffic

OLTP on the other hand, is good for huge traffic millisecond data retrieval. but not good for storing huge data

redshift is a columnar storage database
