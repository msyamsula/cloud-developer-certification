there is some point that need to be kept in mind when architecting app for global infrastructure

1. deploy your app close to your user
2. introduce redundancy for disaster recovery
3. create multiple server for load distribution
4. distribute your server to decrease 1 point of failure, crash, DoS, hacker, etc
