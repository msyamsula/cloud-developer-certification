root user is a very powerfull account. It can do almost anything on your account.
this is a user when you first create your account.
it is not recommended to perform daily administrative task with this account. use IAM user instead.
having said that, there is only task that can only be done by root user such as:

1. close your aws account
2. change S3 bucket policy
3. sign up for govCloud
4. register as seller in amazon marketplace
5. change account setting (account name, email, password)
6. restore IAM user permission
7. view tax invoice
8. change or cancel aws support plan
