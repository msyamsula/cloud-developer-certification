route53 is a DNS service provided by aws

DNS service is like a phone book. it can map domain name to IP address of our server.

there are some well known mapping in DNS (called record)
1. A record (it maps DNS to IPv4)
2. AAAA record (maps DNS to IPv6)
3. CNAME record (maps DNS to DNS)
4. alias record (maps DNS to aws resource)


route53 has several "route policy"
1. simple, no health check, you just get ip address every request.
2. weighted, this is useful if you have multiple instance mapped to one DNS, you can assign weight on the route policy that specify percentage of traffic to a certain IP from your IP addresses.
3. latency, this will help you reduce latency. by routing the DNS to IP address that has lowest latency
4. disaster recovery, basically you set up a failover IP address that will be used when primary IP address fail.
