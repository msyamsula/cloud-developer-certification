WAF = web application firewall & shield. are defence mechanism of aws for your instance.
as the name suggest. in it a firewall that happen in web application (HTTP protection) against xss, sql injection.
you need to define Web Access Control List (Web ACL) to protect your HTTP

Web ACL can be set to block and allow HTTP request based on
1. http method, header, body.
2. geo location
3. ip address
4. rate

this mainly implemented to mitigate DDoS (distributed denial of service)

DDoS happen when hacker run multiple instance of bot to try to cripple your web application. by choking it with traffic.
so normal user will experienced a more latency and waiting time.

the way we defend ourself in aws is by using shield and waf

1. standard shield is a default shield that is granted to you free automatically
2. premium shield is more secure with additional cost and with high level of defence
3. WAF, create a firewall rule to your instances.
4. leveraging auto scaling group to mitigate heavy load from attacker.
5. Cloudfront and Route53 with WAF and shield to protect the edge location.
