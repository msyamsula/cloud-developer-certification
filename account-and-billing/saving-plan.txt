saving plan is another way to pay aws.
instead of thinking about how many do we have instances and pay it with on-demand bill.
we can have up to 72 % discount by committing to a certain amount of dollar in each mount in one region(1,3,5 years).
you pay this saving plan as all upfront, partial upfront, no upfront.

there are 3 saving plan in aws:
1. ec2 saving plan, saving plan for ec2
2. compute saving plan, compute family saving plan (ec2, fargate, ecs)
3. machine learning saving plan, sage maker.
