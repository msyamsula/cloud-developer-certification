VPC peering, site to site vpn, and direct connect can handle VPC merger if the VPC is low in quantity.

if you have hundred of VPC that need to be connected. using three approach above will become messy (using the fact that it is not transitive).

so, to tackle this problem. all of your VPC can connect to a single service called "transit gateway" in a star topology.

by this, all your VPC is connected through this transit gateway.
