imagine you have an ec2 in aws, you run some program/API that is short-executed.

if you think about it. Although the functionality is short-executed, you still have to run your server 24 hours. and pay hourly rate

this is where aws lambda come in play. You only pay as your API/program executed.

lambda is auto-scalling service. so when your API/program got a lot of traffic, the server will adjust accordingly.

some use case of lambda but not limited to

1. cron

lambda usually very cheap
