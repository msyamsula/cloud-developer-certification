based on retention policy, encryption, and easy access, there are several storage class in s3
which are:
1. standard
2. standard Infrequent-access
3. one zone infrequent-access
4. glacier instant retrieval
5. glacier flexible retrieval
6. glacier deep archive
7. Intelligent tiering

when you store data to s3, you can change storage class within s3


storage class explanation
1. standard: this is a default, if you need frequent access use this
2. standard infrequent access: this one is suitable for data that is not frequently accessed but you need fast retrieval when you need it. lower cost than standard (perfect for backup)
3. one zone infrequent acess: this one is a little bit less in term of availability and perfect for secondary backup (backup of your backup)

glacier class
this is a s3 storage class for data that really really infrequent access (archive data).
glacier class will archive and compress the data.
for glacier class you need to pay for storing + retrieving data.

1. glacier instant retrieval: milisecond retrieval (archive that has fast retrieval). perfect for data which are accessed once per quarter
2. glacier flexible retrieval: expedited(1 - 5 minutes), standard (3 to 5 hours), bulk (5 - 12 hours) -> free for bulk, you can use this class for data which has minimum 90 days storing time
3. glacier deep archive: long term archive, standard (12 hours retrieval), bulk (48 hours retrieval), minimum storage duration 180 days

Intelligent tiering, this is an option to move access tiers based on usage within s3 based on below rules
frequent access tier: default (automatic)
infrequent access tier: object not access for 30 days (automatic)
archive instant access tier: object no access for 90 days (automatic)
archive access tier: configurable from 90 - 700+ days (optional)
deep archive access tier: configurable from 180 - 700+ days (optional)
