replication is a way to make multiple s3 bucket to have the same state (contain the same data).
for compliance purpose, redundancy, fault tolerant, high availability, and so on.

you can replicate within the same region (SRR, same region replication) or across region (CRR, cross region replication)
the replication happen asynchronously
proper IAMrole needed for this
bucket can be from different account
replication, versioning in each buckets need to be enabled
replication is a one way direction, you need to setup in both bucket if you want bi-directional replication
