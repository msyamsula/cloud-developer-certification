there are two types of encryption

1. encryption of data at rest. meaning you see encrypted data in storage, not actual data.
2. encryption of data in transit. meaning you may see actual data in storage but you can't see it while it move through some app.


by default.
encryption in transit is applied when you move data from on-premise to aws.

to encrypt your data (whether it is at rest or in transit). you need an encryption key.

AWS KMS (Key Management System) is a service to manage your encryption key.
in KMS we don't necessarilly have the key, we only need to specify who can use it key and AWS will manage it for us.

some resource in AWS offer encryption without KMS and will encrypt your data when you enable the encryption option.
1. EBS volume
2. S3
3. redshift
4. RDS
5. EFS

some will get automatically encrypted. this is just part of that resource work.
1. CloudTrail Logs
2. S3 glacier
3. Storage Gateway


type of encryption key (CMK, Customer Master Key)
1. AWS manage CMK, all encryption key manage and create by aws
2. Customer manage CMK, all encryption key manage and create by customer
3. Cloud HSM key store, all encryption key manage and create with your own cloud HSM.
